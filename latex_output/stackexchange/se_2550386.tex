\section*{Question}
I was dealing with the following question, given by my friend: Let $\xi(x)=\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+\sqrt{\cdots}}}}$ Define the series $X$ as $\xi(1),\xi(2),\xi(3),\dots$ Find $n$ for which $\xi(n)$ is the 51st Whole Number in the series. I solved it, of course, [and interestingly $\xi(1)={{1+\sqrt5}\over2}$, the Golden Ratio] but that led us on a competition in which we would try to find out the value of increasingly convoluted expressions. Some time later, I made an expression, which I called 'The Factorialth Root', written as $\sqrt[!]{x}$. For some $x$, $\sqrt[!]{x}=\sqrt{x\sqrt{(x-1)\sqrt{(x-2)\sqrt{\ddots\sqrt{2\sqrt1}}}}}$ My friend thought that $(x>y)\to(\sqrt[!]{x}y)\to(\sqrt[!]{x}>\sqrt[!]{y})$. I showed by example that mine was correct, but couldn't prove it. My attempt: If $[(x>y)\to(\sqrt[!]{x}>\sqrt[!]{y})]$ is true, then $\sqrt[!]{x}>\sqrt[!]{x-1}$. This is possible only when $x>\sqrt[!]{x-1}$. It follows that $\sqrt[!]{2}>\sqrt[!]{1},\sqrt[!]{3}>\sqrt[!]{2}$, and so on. So, I thought I could prove it by induction, but can't seem to find any way to apply it. Can anyone help?

\section*{Answer}
For $n > 1$, $$\begin{align} \frac{\sqrt[!]{n}}{\sqrt[!]{n-1}} &= \frac{n^{1/2} \cdot (n-1)^{1/4} \cdot (n-2)^{1/8} \cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot 1^{1/2^{n\phantom{-1}}}}{\phantom{n^{1/2}\cdot}(n-1)^{1/2}\cdot(n-2)^{1/4}\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot 1^{1/2^{n-1}}} \\[4pt] &= \frac{n^{1/2}}{(n-1)^{1/4}\cdot(n-2)^{1/8}\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot 1^{1/2^n}} \\[4pt] &= \frac{n^{1/4+1/8+1/16+\cdots+1/2^{n}+1/2^{n}}}{(n-1)^{1/4}\cdot(n-2)^{1/8}\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot 1^{1/2^n}} \\[4pt] &= \left(\frac{n}{n-1}\right)^{1/4}\left(\frac{n}{n-2}\right)^{1/8}\left(\frac{n}{n-3}\right)^{1/16}\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot \left(\frac{n}{1}\right)^{1/2^{n}}\cdot n^{1/2^n} \\[4pt] &> 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot1 \cdot 1 \\[4pt] &= 1 \end{align}$$
